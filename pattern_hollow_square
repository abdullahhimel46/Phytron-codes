Hints: To create a hollow appearance, the outer boundary of the square is formed by asterisks/stars, 
and the interior of the square is left empty.
So, in this code we need  to print spaces in between the outer boundary of the square. In other words, we should 
print star in the first row or first column or last row or last column!
