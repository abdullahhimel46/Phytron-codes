/*
This code checks whether a given matrix is a diagonal square matrix.
If it's square and all non-diagonal elements are zero, it's considered 
as a primary diagonal matrix, and the code prints "Primary diagonal." 
If any of these conditions are not met, it prints "Not diagonal."
*/
/*
Set, flag=1,//let, the matrix is square & diagonal
Step 1: Check the matrix is square or not
Step 2: Check the matrix is diagonal or not
        a)skip diagonal elements and continue(move to next iteration)
        b)check non-diagonal elements
Step 3: If still flag==1; then, it's a diagonal square matrix. So, print diagonal
        else, print not diagonal. Because any of these conditions are not met
